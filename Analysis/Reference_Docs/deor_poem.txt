DEOR POEM (MODERN ENGLISH LITERAL)

Wayland knew the worm of exile.
The strong-minded earl suffered hardships.
He had for companions sorrow and longing,
winter-cold exile; woe he often found,
since Nithhad laid necessity upon him,
supple sinew-bonds on the better man.
That passed away, so may this.

To Beadohild, her brothers' death was not
so painful in her mind as her own problem,
that she had clearly perceived
that she was pregnant; nor could she ever
confidently think how that should turn out.
That passed away, so may this.

We have heard that about Maethhild,
the Geat's lusts became boundless,
that sorrowful love took all sleep from them.
That passed away, so may this.

Theodric held for thirty winters
the fortress of the Maerings; that was known to many.
That passed away, so may this.

We have learned of Eormanric's
wolf-like though; he owned the wide folk
of the Goth's kingdom. That was a grim king.
Many a man sat bound in sorrows,
woe in expectation, wished often
that the kingdom were overcome.
That passed away, so may this.

He sits sorrow-anxious, deprived of joy,
darkens in his mind, thinks to himself
that his share of hardships is endless.
He may then think that throughout this world
the wise Lord turns often,
shows honor to many an earl,
certain glory, to some a share of woes.
That I will say about myself,
that I was for a while the poet of the Heodenings,
dear to my lord. Deor was my name.
I had for many winters a good office,
a loyal lord, until Heorrenda now,
a song-crafty man, received the land-right
that the protector of earls formerly gave me.
That passed away, so may this.
