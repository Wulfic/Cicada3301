## Analysis
- **Structure:** `EAI-T.TTH-EASAMEAS-THAT` suggests "EA IT T THE SAME AS THAT".
- **Phrases:** `SAME AS THAT`, `THE OTHER`, `WITH AR`, `THE STAR` (if `THSTHR`), `THE SONG`.
- **Remaining Noise:** Some segments like `EAN-WIOPGEAUDAA` are still gibberish, indicating the key might need further refinement in other positions. At Key Length 43, fixing one section (indexes 6-14) affects text every 43 characters.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue crib dragging on other "noisy" words.
- `WITHAR` -> `WITH A`?
- `THEOORTHEONG` -> `THE O OR THE ONG`? (The O or The Ong?)
