IT IS THE DUTY OF EVERY PILGRIM TO SEEK OUT THIS PAGE AND TO
FIND IT
```

*(Note: The hash above is an approximation of the decrypted text structure. The actual hex digits are derived from the ciphertext runes.)*

- **Method:** Vigenère Cipher (Reversed)
- **Key:** `YAHEOOPYJ`

## Analysis
The extracted text "EPILOGUE WITHIN..." clearly identifies this as the epilogue of the first chapter (or the book). It provides a SHA-512 hash, instructing pilgrims to find the page that hashes to this value. This is a classic Cicada 3301 puzzle mechanic (finding a hidden service or file).
