## Method
Index of Coincidence analysis indicated a Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher (IC ~0.06).
Initial pattern matching on rune sequences suggested `J-I-H-E-I-IA-I` matched `BELIEVE` and `N-I-P-P-R-OE-I` matched `MESSAGE`.
A full Reciprocal Substitution Cipher was derived from these consistent word patterns.
Word separators were identified as the `•` dots in the raw rune text.
Rune `D` maps to `K` and `C` maps to `D`.
