## Cryptanalysis Status

### ❌ Failed Attempts

| Method | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Hill Climbing (IoC/Bigram) | "theatheatheatheath..." - GIBBERISH |
| φ(prime) shift | "LDSRYOUAEYT..." - GIBBERISH |
| Standard Vigenère | No readable output |
| Autokey | Not tested |

### Key Observations

1. **Part of Pages 18-54 Block**: This page is part of the 37 consecutive unsolved pages
2. **IoC Analysis**: IoC ≈ 0.034 (matches random 1/29 distribution)
3. **Running Key Suspected**: Low IoC suggests running key cipher, not periodic key
4. **Related to Page 55**: Page 55 immediately follows with φ(prime) "AN END" message

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Test running key cipher with Self-Reliance as key source
2. Try autokey cipher (plaintext extends key)
3. Check for interleaving with other pages (18-53)
4. Look for patterns across the 37-page block
5. Consider position-dependent cipher (key varies by position in book)
