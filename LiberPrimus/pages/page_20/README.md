## Cryptanalysis Status

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Jan 2026)

### Failed Attacks (Jan 2026)
1.  **Split Stream (Primes vs Non-Primes):**
    *   Separated Prime-Valued Runes from Non-Primes.
    *   Attempted to use one as Key for the other.
    *   Result: IoC 1.11 (Random).
2.  **Grid Transposition:**
    *   Rearranged columns based on Prime indices.
    *   Result: IoC 1.00.
3.  **Deor Poem Attacks:**
    *   Tested "Deor Refrain" as Key. (IoC 0.98)
    *   Tested "Sorted Primes" as indices into Deor Poem. (IoC 1.00)
    *   Tested extracting Prime Lines of Deor.

### Current Hypothesis
The hint "REARRANGING THE PRIMES NUMBERS WILL SHOW A PATH TO THE DEOR K" (from Page 19) is valid.
It suggests a Running Key derived from the *Deor* poem, but the method of "Rearranging Primes" to build this key is not yet cracked. Matches suggest "Deor K" might mean "Deor Key".
